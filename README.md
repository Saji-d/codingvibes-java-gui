CodingVibes is a Java Swing–based desktop application developed as part of academic coursework. The project simulates a course purchasing and management system using a menu-driven graphical interface. It focuses on application flow design, role-based access, and event-driven programming rather than real-world transactions.

The system includes separate User and Admin modes and demonstrates how a real-world course platform might function at a conceptual level.

## ✨ Features

### User Mode
- Graphical user interface built using Java Swing
- Browse available courses through a structured menu
- Select multiple courses and add them to a **simulated shopping cart**
- View selected courses in the cart
- Remove courses from the cart if no longer needed
- Proceed through a **simulated purchase workflow**
- Choose between simulated payment options:
  - Card payment (simulation only)
  - Mobile payment (simulation only)
- View an **About** section describing the application
- Access a **Contact Us** section displaying simulated:
  - Office location
  - Email address
  - Contact number
- View a **Reviews** section showing predefined customer feedback (static reviews)

> Note: All purchase, payment, contact, and review functionalities are simulated and do not perform real transactions or communications.

### Admin Mode
- Separate admin interface with restricted access
- Add new users to the system
- Update existing user information
- Delete users from the system
- Modify and manage user records through admin controls

---

### General
- Role-based system with distinct User and Admin functionalities
- Event-driven application design using Java Swing components
- Menu-driven workflow that simulates real-world application behavior
- Modular source code structure for clarity and maintainability
